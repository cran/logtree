# Beyond the glyph slots, each preset carries five non-glyph slots: `elapsed`
# (how a close line's time column is gated and styled), `trace` (the optional
# call-site column), `timestamp` (the optional wall-clock column), plus `crumb`
# (breadcrumb separator + the styling that sets the path apart from the message)
# and `summary` (the digest's divider layout), the last two used only by
# logtree_summary(). They live in the theme so there is one place to customise
# appearance -- logtree_theme() -- rather than a second, options-based channel.
#
# `trace` ships `show = FALSE` in every preset: capturing a call site costs a
# frame walk and a srcref lookup per logged line, so it is opt-in and the
# default path pays nothing. Its `format` is deliberately ASCII-only, like any
# other default that lands in package source.
#
# `timestamp` ships `format = NULL` in every preset, which is off: a live tree
# read as it happens does not need to be told the time, and every column that
# is not there is one the message has room for. It is the log read afterwards
# that wants it, which is why it costs nothing until asked for.
#
# The `done` slot also carries `text`, the word a close line prints before its
# elapsed time. It is read per status (falling back to `done`'s, then to
# "Done"), so a preset -- or a user -- can rename or drop it.

# The trace column's default styling, shared by the coloured presets. It is a
# per-part list rather than one style for the whole column: the call site is
# supporting detail, so all of it stays faint, but the location and the function
# name are different kinds of thing and read better told apart.
#
# There are two parts, not three: `file` and `line` are one thing you act on, so
# `location` styles (and links) the whole `{file}:{line}` run, separator
# included. `base` is everything else, which in the default format is the `()`
# after the function name.
