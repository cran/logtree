# memory should say the same things. So the flattening lives here, once, and the

# every other kind carries them on `entry`, and that a group has a `name` where

#' Add a file sink
#'
#' Registers an additional output destination. Every logged event fans out
#' to the console sink and every registered file sink, so console, text-file,
#' and NDJSON outputs can all run simultaneously (design doc section 6).
#'
#' A `"json"` sink writes one NDJSON object per event, with these fields:
#'
#' | Field | What it holds |
#' | ----- | ------------- |
#' | `ts` | when the event was emitted, ISO-8601 to the millisecond with UTC offset |
#' | `run_id` | identifies the run, so one run's lines can be picked out of a shared file |
#' | `level` | event kind: `"open"`, `"close"`, `"group"`, `"group_close"`, `"leaf"` |
#' | `id`, `parent_id`, `depth` | the node's identity and place in the tree |
#' | `label` | a step's label, a group's name, or a leaf's message |
#' | `elapsed` | seconds, on close lines only; `null` elsewhere |
#' | `status` | a leaf's status, `"step"`/`"group"` on an opening line, or the resolved status on a close |
#' | `fn`, `file`, `line` | the call site, when the `trace` theme slot recorded one; `null` otherwise |
#'
#' @param path File path to append rendered log lines to.
#' @param format `"text"` for a plain ASCII tree (no ANSI, independent of
#'   the active console theme) or `"json"` for one NDJSON object per event.
#' @param timestamp Whether this sink prints the wall-clock column (see the
#'   `timestamp` slot in [logtree_theme()]). `NULL` (the default) follows the
#'   active console theme, read afresh for each event; `FALSE` pins it off;
#'   `TRUE` turns it on with a date-and-time format suited to a file that
#'   outlives the session (`"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`); a `strftime` format string
#'   pins that format. Text sinks only: a `"json"` sink always carries `ts`.
#' @param threshold Minimum leaf level this file records: one of `"debug"`,
#'   `"info"`, `"warn"`, `"error"`. `NULL` (the default) follows the global
#'   [logtree_threshold()]. This is per sink, so a `"debug"` file can record
#'   everything while the console stays at `"info"` -- or an `"error"` file can
#'   keep only what went wrong. Step open/close lines are never gated.
#' @param trace Whether this sink prints the call-site column (see the `trace`
#'   slot in [logtree_theme()]). `NULL` (the default) follows the active console
#'   theme, read afresh for each event, so switching trace on reaches the file
#'   too; `FALSE`, `TRUE` or `"problems"` pins this sink independently of the
#'   console. Text sinks only: a `"json"` sink always carries the `fn`, `file`
#'   and `line` fields, `null` when there is no call site to report.
#' @return The sink's id, invisibly -- pass it to [logtree_sink_remove()] to
#'   stop writing to this file.
#' @seealso [logtree_sink()] for a sink of your own, [logtree_sinks()] and
#'   [logtree_sink_remove()] for the registry.
