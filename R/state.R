# --- Mute ------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `the$muted` is checked in emit() *after* record_summary(), which is the whole
# design in one line: muting is about output, not about memory. A muted run
# still knows what went wrong and can still be asked at the end.
#
# It is checked in emit() rather than implemented by unregistering sinks,
# because unregistering loses the configuration and this does not -- and because
# step bookkeeping must be untouched either way: the stack still pushes and pops
# while muted, or depth would desync the moment logging came back.
#
# Like sinks, and for the same reason, it is not cleared by logtree_reset().

#' Silence logtree's output
#'
#' Stops every sink -- console, files, and any of your own -- from receiving
#' events, without unregistering them. This is what a library that logs with
#' logtree reaches for to keep its own test suite quiet, and what a script
#' reaches for around a noisy section.
#'
#' Three things muting deliberately does *not* do:
#'
#' * It does not stop the run being *recorded*. Warnings and errors still reach
#'   the [logtree_summary()] digest, so a muted run can still be asked what went
#'   wrong at the end -- and `logtree_summary()` still prints when you call it,
#'   since that output is one you asked for rather than one that happened to you.
#'   The [with_logging()] run-summary line, which you did not ask for, is
#'   silenced.
#' * It does not disturb step bookkeeping. Steps still open and close while
#'   muted, so depth is still correct when output comes back.
#' * It does not survive... anything, actually: like registered sinks, and
#'   unlike the open-step stack, the mute flag is left alone by
#'   [logtree_reset()]. Unmute explicitly.
#'
#' The `logtree.silent` option sets the initial state when the package is
#' loaded, for silencing logtree from an `.Rprofile` or a test setup file; after
#' that these functions are in charge, so a later `options(logtree.silent = )`
#' has no effect.
#'
#' @return The previous muted state (`TRUE`/`FALSE`), invisibly, so a caller can
#'   restore whatever it found.
#' @seealso [logtree_sink_remove()] for taking a sink off altogether.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' logtree_reset()

#' f <- function() {
#'   log_step("Load data")
#'   log_warn("coerced 3 rows")
#' }
#' invisible(f())          # prints nothing
#'
#' logtree_unmute()
#' # ... but the run was still recorded:
#' length(logtree_summary())

#' Reset internal logtree state
#'
#' Clears the open-step stack and resets the internal id counter. Mainly
#' useful for tests and interactive/knitr re-runs where a previous run may
#' have left the stack non-empty (e.g. after an uncaught error with no
#' `with_logging()` wrapper).
#'
#' Registered sinks are deliberately *not* cleared: they are configuration
#' rather than run state, so a file sink set up once keeps recording across
#' resets. Take one off with [logtree_sink_remove()].
#'
#' @return `NULL`, invisibly.
