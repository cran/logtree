# The summary digest accumulates notable events (warnings, errors, and any step
# that ends badly) with a breadcrumb path, so logtree_summary() can report "what
# went wrong" at the end of a run without scrolling the whole timeline. It is
# fed by record_summary(), called at the top of emit() (R/appenders.R), and
# cleared by logtree_reset() -- it is a stateful accumulator, not a sink (sinks
# render every event and survive reset; this must clear on reset).

# Does `desc` sit at or below `anc` in the tree? True when the paths are equal
# or `anc` is a prefix of `desc`. Used to collapse an uncaught error's
# handler-leaf plus every ancestor close into a single entry at its deepest
# point (see record_summary()).
covers <- function(anc, desc) {

#   * leaf   -- iff summary = TRUE, or (summary = NA and it is a warning/error).
#   * close  -- iff the step resolved to error/warning/interrupted AND no
#     already-buffered entry sits at or below its path (dedup: keeps one entry
#     per failure at its deepest point). Closes fire deepest-first, so the
#     deeper entry is always buffered before the shallower ancestor arrives.

# Does the digest want a leaf of this status, logged with this `summary`
# argument? `TRUE` pins it, `FALSE` excludes it, `NA` (the default) records only
# warnings and errors. Shared with emit_leaf() (R/leaves.R), which asks the same
# question one step earlier to decide whether the leaf is worth building at all.

#' Report a digest of notable events
#'
#' Prints a compact end-of-run digest of everything worth attention that
#' happened since the last [logtree_reset()]: every warning and error leaf line,
#' plus any step that closed with a `warning`, `error`, or `interrupted` status.
#' Each entry shows the status glyph, the breadcrumb path to where it happened,
#' and the message (for leaf lines) or an outcome word (for steps).
#'
#' Unlike scrolling the live tree, the digest surfaces breakage even when no
#' [with_logging()] handler was installed -- interrupted steps are picked up
#' from their close lines. Ordinary `info` / `success` lines are excluded unless
#' logged with `summary = TRUE`; a warning or error can be excluded with
#' `summary = FALSE`.
#'
#' The digest's appearance comes from the active theme, so it is customised
#' through [logtree_theme()] like everything else: the `crumb` slot sets the
#' breadcrumb separator and the emphasis on the path nodes, the `summary` slot
#' the divider (`gap`, `rule`, `line`). `gap`, `rule` and `trace` below override
#' the theme for a single call.
#'
#' @param filter Optional character vector of statuses to include, e.g.
#'   `"error"` or `c("warning", "interrupted")`. Only entries whose status
#'   matches are printed and returned; recognised statuses are `"error"`,
#'   `"warning"`, `"interrupted"`, and the pinned leaf statuses `"info"`,
#'   `"success"`, `"debug"`. `NULL` (the default) reports every entry.
#' @param depth Optional positive integer limiting how many trailing (deepest)
#'   breadcrumb nodes are printed. The message counts as the terminal node, so
#'   `depth = 1` prints just the message (or, for a step entry, its innermost
#'   step), `depth = 2` the message plus its immediate parent, and so on.
#'   `NULL` (the default) prints the full breadcrumb. Affects printing only; the
#'   returned entries always carry the full `path`.
#' @param gap Number of blank lines printed between the last log line and the
#'   digest; `0` prints the digest flush against the tree. `NULL` (the default)
#'   takes the active theme's `summary$gap` (`1` in every built-in preset).
#' @param rule Divider drawn above the digest. `TRUE` draws a [cli::rule()]
#'   labelled with the digest header, so the counts become the rule's title
#'   instead of a separate line; `FALSE` draws no rule and keeps the plain
#'   header line; a character string draws the rule with that title and prints
#'   the header line below it. `NULL` (the default) takes the active theme's
#'   `summary$rule` (`TRUE` in every built-in preset).
#' @param trace Pins the digest's call-site column for this call, overriding the
#'   theme's `trace$show`. Takes the same values: `FALSE` for no call sites,
#'   `TRUE` for all of them, `"problems"`, or a vector of statuses such as
#'   `"error"` -- see [logtree_theme()]. `NULL` (the default) follows the theme,
#'   so the digest agrees with the tree. Useful when the tree was quiet and the
#'   digest is where you want the locations, or the reverse. Note this can only
#'   narrow or reshape what was *captured*: capture is decided while the run
#'   happens, so with the theme's slot off for the run there is nothing for
#'   `trace = TRUE` here to print. To get the quiet-tree-annotated-digest
#'   combination, ask for capture during the run and print nothing:
#'   `logtree_theme(list(trace = list(show = FALSE, capture = TRUE)))`, then
#'   `logtree_summary(trace = TRUE)`.
#' @return The recorded entries, invisibly: a list of records, each a list with
#'   `kind`, `status`, `msg`, `path` (character vector), `elapsed`, and `trace`
#'   (the call site: a list of `fn`, `file` and `line`, or `NULL` when the
#'   `trace` theme slot was off and nothing was captured).
