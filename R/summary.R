# The summary digest accumulates notable events (warnings, errors, and any step
# that ends badly) with a breadcrumb path, so logtree_summary() can report "what
# went wrong" at the end of a run without scrolling the whole timeline. It is
# fed by record_summary(), called at the top of emit() (R/appenders.R), and
# cleared by logtree_reset() -- it is a stateful accumulator, not a sink (sinks
# render every event and survive reset; this must clear on reset).

# Does `desc` sit at or below `anc` in the tree? True when the paths are equal
# or `anc` is a prefix of `desc`. Used to collapse an uncaught error's
# handler-leaf plus every ancestor close into a single entry at its deepest
# point (see record_summary()).

#   * leaf   -- iff summary = TRUE, or (summary = NA and it is a warning/error).
#   * close  -- iff the step resolved to error/warning/interrupted AND no
#     already-buffered entry sits at or below its path (dedup: keeps one entry
#     per failure at its deepest point). Closes fire deepest-first, so the
#     deeper entry is always buffered before the shallower ancestor arrives.

#' Report a digest of notable events
#'
#' Prints a compact end-of-run digest of everything worth attention that
#' happened since the last [logtree_reset()]: every warning and error leaf line,
#' plus any step that closed with a `warning`, `error`, or `interrupted` status.
#' Each entry shows the status glyph, the breadcrumb path to where it happened,
#' and the message (for leaf lines) or an outcome word (for steps).
#'
#' Unlike scrolling the live tree, the digest surfaces breakage even when no
#' [with_logging()] handler was installed -- interrupted steps are picked up
#' from their close lines. Ordinary `info` / `success` lines are excluded unless
#' logged with `summary = TRUE`; a warning or error can be excluded with
#' `summary = FALSE`.
#'
#' @param filter Optional character vector of statuses to include, e.g.
#'   `"error"` or `c("warning", "interrupted")`. Only entries whose status
#'   matches are printed and returned; recognised statuses are `"error"`,
#'   `"warning"`, `"interrupted"`, and the pinned leaf statuses `"info"`,
#'   `"success"`, `"debug"`. `NULL` (the default) reports every entry.
#' @param depth Optional positive integer limiting how many trailing (deepest)
#'   breadcrumb nodes are printed. The message counts as the terminal node, so
#'   `depth = 1` prints just the message (or, for a step entry, its innermost
#'   step), `depth = 2` the message plus its immediate parent, and so on.
#'   `NULL` (the default) prints the full breadcrumb. Affects printing only; the
#'   returned entries always carry the full `path`.
#' @return The recorded entries, invisibly: a list of records, each a list with
#'   `kind`, `status`, `msg`, `path` (character vector), and `elapsed`.
